# The Yates Adventure

This is an ambitious project. I plan on elevating my portfolio to be an interactive game in which one can read my resume, view my projects, send me a contact submission, and explore my education all within an RPG style adventure game. This project was created with help from **[Chris Courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP5DKzriqXA)**.
